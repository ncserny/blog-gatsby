#### Some thoughts on Crypto, Web3 and NFTs. We're still early, until we're late.

##### Bitcoin
* Bitcoin closed the worst month ever. If your time horizon is more than 4 years this doesn't really matter. I'll continue stacking BTC, ETH and 2-3 select altcoins.

* PlanB was wrong, a bunch of others too, that can happen. I really thought Bitcoin would go to $100k, oh well. The chart looks okay-ish. See first point about time horizon.

* Now everybody is talking about the 4 year cycles again but nobody really knows. The more people think BTC follows a very defined pattern, the less I trust it. What I think is for sure, is that theoretically BTC's price appreciates due to the limited supply after each halving.

###### Ethereum, EVMs, L2s

* Ethereum is still the king and will remain so for a long(er) time. I think the bear market will actually help both ETH and BTC sucking out liquidity from the other chains
* Using L2s (Layer 2) still sucks and MetaMask doesn't help with creating great UX. There isn't basically any experience other than pain. Phantom on the other hand does a great job in UX/UI.
* Chains with a multi-chain approach like Avalanche (AVAX) and Polkadot (DOT) make it even more complicated. I call myself quite crypto-savvy and using all these X-, Y-, Z-Chains on AVAX was painful. Do you rather take a nonstop flight somewhere or like stop-overs (L1 > L2)
* Solana is one of the few non EVM chains that do a great job in terms of UX and tooling. The uptime, for now, not so much.
* EVM chains with minimal novelty, or that only use a different consensus mechanism which most of the time it is, will have a hard time once ecosystem funds dry up. Then Ethereum's L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, etc. will swallow a bunch of their revenue

###### DeFi, NFTs, Fugazis

* A lot of DeFi Fugazis will vanish, at latest when VC funds dry up and there isn't enough user adoption. Generating magic internet money was fun while it latest.
* NFTs have dumped like crazy in price. Usage on Solana and ImmutableX is still going up, which is a good sign. Interestingly, Solana does nearly double the volume of transactions with a little more than half of the buyers. Assets on Ethereum still has the highest valued assets
![NFT Blockchain Volume](./nft-blockchain-volume-30days.jpg)
* NFTs that provided you with utility through staking to receive tokens, are having a hard time. Their token price and usage has gone down dramatically. So much that if you still hold some, the only option now is to hodl.

We're still early, until we're late.
