In the bull market, that is now behind us, hundreds of NFT projects minted each day with a lot of hype being generated around them. Some were wildly successful, some were rugs, some were slow rugs... A lot of them also offer staking to receive a token you can use and hopefully appreciates in price. Which ones are actually successful? Let's take a quick look.

### Most used tokens in transactions
Taking the most popular NFT tokens by holder count and looking at their transactions, you can see that transactions for GST and DUST are consistently highest while others only briefly spike and/or are much further behind. Staking might provide you with tokens but that doesn't mean they can be used for anything or have actual value.

While $GST is in decline, $DUST transactions are on the rise which speaks for a healthy usage growth. ðŸ¤© In a bear market it's pretty natural that you see more selling pressure though.

### Price action of NFT tokens
Far down in usage are once hyped tokens from projects like Monke Rejects (24hr volume: $204.67), Moneyboys (24hr vol: $502.71) and others. This also culminates in catastrophic price action and abysmal trading volume.
